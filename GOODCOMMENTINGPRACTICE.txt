what makes for good code comments?
In general, I think a code comment should help improve readability of said code
so someone who is not the author can understand what is going on when looking
at the code. Good comments also help the author organize their thoughts when 
writing a code and may help segment a large code into smaller sections,
making it easier to find a specific spot in the code.
When writing code, I like to first make comments of the overall objectives of
the assignment defined by assingment information.
For example, when creating a class, I use comments to specify constructors, mutators, operators, etc.
I also find comments useful above loops, to show what the purpose of the loop is. This principle applies to many other concepts besides loops.
