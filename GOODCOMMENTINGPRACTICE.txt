what makes for good code comments?

In general, I think a code comment should help improve readability of said code
so someone who is not the author can understand what is going on when looking
at the code. Good comments also help the author organize their thoughts when 
writing a code and may help segment a large code into smaller sections,
making it easier to find a specific spot in the code. Sectioning off code with comments will make it easier to read 
and easier to work on since you can refer back to it to find where to make edits

When writing code, I like to first make comments of the overall objectives of
the assignment defined by assingment information.
For example, when creating a class, I use comments to specify constructors, mutators, operators, etc.
I also find comments useful above loops, to show what the purpose of the loop is. This principle applies to many other concepts besides loops. 
I have also used comments to help keep track of variables in my code because changing variables often can make it difficult to keep track of their value
and comments can both identify a variables value and allow for them to be spotted easeier in code.
