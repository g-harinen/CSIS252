Things to do when (asynchronously) working in a CSIS group
1.) administrator: create group repository to easily share files between members and keep each other updated on progress.
2.) documenter: responsible for checking on the correctness of the documentation standards of the project once completed (README, naming conventions, etc)
3.) debugger: responsible for debugging code, as well as testing code and finding possible issues in said code.

For our asynchronous group, LucasCB and GarretH, these roles were used interchangeably, as we would write our own work, and check each others once completed.
