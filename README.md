September 27th Readme Activity
****This is a readme file from assignment 8 

To run this program use the makefile with the executable 'prog8'

This program reads in an array from the user and outputs the sum of the array using a recursive function. 

Input is from the keyboard of the user and output is all through cout. It is formatted in normal line by line text. 

To test this program I ran it many times using different input from me to make sure it could handle different input. No bugs should remain and some troubleshooting I ran into was some complicaitons using arrays and their sizing. 

This program is recursive because it makes it much easier to read and understand as well as being a good way to get the sum of arrays that can vary drastically in size because of the way that a recursive function can call itself. If this function were iterative it may be more difficult to understand and could overall be more complicated and less able to handle different arrays of varying size without becoming much more difficult to code.




file		function		description
-------------	-------------------	-------------------------
main.cpp	main			main driving function
sumList.cpp	recursive function	gives the sum of an array 
makefile	makefile		handles compiling

****This file could be better if it included a header with authors name, date, assignment, etc
