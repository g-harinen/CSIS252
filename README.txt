how to use makefile:
instead of using g++ to compile each file in the directory, we can now
use the command 'make' to compile all files in the directory simultaneously.
Once the files have been compiled, we do not need to use a.out to run our program. 
Now, we can use the executable 'prog' to run our program. This example makefile runs a program that declares a class object of sampleclass type.
